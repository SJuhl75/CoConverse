Accurate conversion of Earth-Fixed Earth-Centered Coordinates to Geodetic Coordinates.

"A closed form algorithm for the exact transformation of Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF)
coordinates to geodetic coordinates is presented that is computationally fast, safe and accurate.
Boosting the computational robustness of Jijie Zhuâ€™s algorithm, it reduces the worst case
transformation error by up to 500 million times."

Porting the algorithms described in Mr. Osen Paper from C language to php.
+ Adding haversine (found on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/365826/calculate-distance-between-2-gps-coordinates)
+ and Vincenty's algorithm (https://gist.github.com/lkacenja/41b5bd876d61b806433f)

... for calculation of baseline distance between to GNSS marks.
